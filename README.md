# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include the passenger safety cell with the crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems.Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.

So task is to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler’s standards.

# I performed following actions:
* For any column(s), the variance is equal to zero,is removed.
* Checked for null and unique values for test and train sets
* Applied label encoder.
* Performed dimensionality reduction.
* Predicted on test values using xgboost
